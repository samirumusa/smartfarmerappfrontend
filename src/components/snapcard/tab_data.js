Spores from one tree only affect the other and vice versa. For instance, the spores on apple trees only infect cedar while the spores found on cedar trees only affect apples. The damage done to the leaves greatly affects the apple trees\’ ability to gather sunlight and nutrients from the air, damaging its health and fruit production, and in some cases causing death.',
       'Prevention':{'0':'If you see the lesions on the apple leaves or fruit, it is too late to control the fungus. In that case, you should focus on purging infected leaves and fruit from around your tree. Spraying apple trees with copper can be done to treat cedar apple rust and prevent other fungal infections.','1':'The best way to control cedar apple rust is to prevent infection using a mixture of cultural methods and chemical treatments.','2':'Don\’t plant junipers near rust-susceptible plants, which include both apples and crabapples.

It contains myclobutanil as its active ingredient. Typically, you should spray every 7-10 days during the period of infection.'},
