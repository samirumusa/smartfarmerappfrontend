      content="This is an app that uses deep learning to recognise a plant disease from the image of a leaf. It also
      helps the farmer by identifying the name and type of a plant from an image. It is very easy to use, the
      only thing a farmer would do is to snap a picture and our app would tell him which type of plant itâ€™s or
      whether the plant is healthy or unhealthy and type and level of the disease."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
