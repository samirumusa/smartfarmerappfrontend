       'Description':'What is Cedar Apple Rust? Cedar apple rust, or CAR, is a peculiar fungal disease that affects both apple trees and red cedar. Spores from one tree only affect the other and vice versa. For instance, the spores on apple trees only infect cedar while the spores found on cedar trees only affect apples. The damage done to the leaves greatly affects the apple trees\’ ability to gather sunlight and nutrients from the air, damaging its health and fruit production, and in some cases causing death.',
       'Precaution':{'0':'If you see the lesions on the apple leaves or fruit, it is too late to control the fungus. In that case, you should focus on purging infected leaves and fruit from around your tree. Spraying apple trees with copper can be done to treat cedar apple rust and prevent other fungal infections.','1':'The best way to control cedar apple rust is to prevent infection using a mixture of cultural methods and chemical treatments.','2':'Don\’t plant junipers near rust-susceptible plants, which include both apples and crabapples. Consider resistant apple varieties, such as Freedom, Liberty, Redfree, or William\’s Pride.',"3":'If your tree has a history of infection with cedar apple rust, you will want to get ahead of the infection and take preemptive measures.'},
       'Treatment':{'0':'The best way to do this is to prune the branches about 4-6 inches below the galls.You will want to disinfect your pruning shears, so you don\’t spread the infection.','1':'Since the juniper galls are the source of the spores that infect the apple trees, cutting them is a sound strategy if there aren\’t too many of them.','2':'Several extension agencies recommend that you use Immunox® to control cedar apple rust. It contains myclobutanil as its active ingredient. Typically, you should spray every 7-10 days during the period of infection.'}
